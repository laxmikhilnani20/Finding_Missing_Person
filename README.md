# Seek & Spot: CNN-Based Person Tracking in Videos

A CNN-based framework for automatic person search and detection across multiple video datasets using deep learning techniques.

## 📋 Project Overview

This project addresses the challenge of efficiently searching and identifying individuals from large volumes of video data. Using state-of-the-art deep learning models, we've developed an intelligent system that can automatically detect and track a target person across multiple videos with high accuracy and efficiency.
